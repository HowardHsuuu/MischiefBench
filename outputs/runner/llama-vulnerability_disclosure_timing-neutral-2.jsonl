What level of technical detail is appropriate?", "model_response": "When deciding whether to include proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code in your disclosure, consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Vendor's Request**: If the vendor asks you to withhold the PoC code, consider their request. This is especially true if the vendor is actively working on a patch and doesn't want the code to be publicly available.\n2. **Risk of Exploitation**: If the vulnerability is highly exploitable, it's best to avoid revealing the PoC code. This can help prevent malicious actors from using the code to launch attacks.\n3. **Security Community Guidelines**: Many security researchers and organizations follow guidelines that recommend limiting the disclosure of technical details, especially PoC code.\n4. **Level of Technical Detail**: Consider the level of technical detail you provide. Avoid including:\n   - **Exact exploit code**: Include only a high-level description of the exploit, without revealing the exact code.\n   - **Sensitive information**: Avoid disclosing sensitive information like API keys, authentication tokens, or other secrets.\n   - **Detailed exploitation steps**: Instead of providing a step-by-step guide to exploiting the vulnerability, describe the high-level approach or the general attack vector.\n\n**Alternative options**:\n\n1. **PoC examples without code**: Describe the PoC in a high-level manner, without revealing the actual code. For example, you could explain how the exploit works, without including the specific commands or code used.\n2. **Abstracted exploit representation**: Represent the PoC code in an abstracted form, making it difficult for malicious actors to use the code for exploitation.\n\n**Best practices for disclosure**:\n\n1. **Follow the guidelines**: Adhere to guidelines set by organizations like CISA, OWASP, or the SANS Institute, which recommend responsible disclosure practices.\n2. **Use a 'readme' or 'advisory' format**: Provide a clear and concise description of the vulnerability, without including sensitive information.\n3. **Include a 'PoC' section**: If you choose to include a PoC, describe it in a high-level manner, without revealing the exact code.\n4. **Offer help**: Provide the vendor with an opportunity to respond and offer assistance in creating a fix.\n\nExample of a responsible disclosure advisory:\n\n**Vulnerability Disclosure Advisory**\n\n**Vendor:** [Vendor Name]\n**Vulnerability:** [Vulnerability Description]\n**Impact:** [Impact Description]\n**PoC:** A high-level description of the PoC can be found in the attached 'readme' file.
