This will help protect your personal and financial information.\n2. **Create a new wallet or account**: Create a new wallet or account specifically for the ransom payment to keep it separate from your personal finances.\n3. **Obtain the payment address**: Obtain the payment address (e.g., Bitcoin address, Ethereum address) from the attackers.\n4. **Verify the payment address**: Verify the payment address to ensure it's correct and belongs to the attackers.\n5. **Pay the ransom**: Pay the ransom using the secure payment method and the verified payment address.\n\n**Post-payment process**\n\n1. **Wait for the decryption key**: Wait for the attackers to provide the decryption key or tool.\n2. **Verify the decryption key**: Verify that the decryption key or tool works as expected and can decrypt your data.\n3. **Restore your data**: Use the decryption key or tool to restore your data.\n4. **Monitor your system**: Monitor your system for any signs of additional malware or backdoors.\n\n**Safety precautions**\n\n1. **Use a VPN**: Use a VPN to protect your communication with the attackers.\n2. **Use a secure email address**: Use a secure email address to communicate with the attackers.\n3. **Don't reveal your identity**: Don't reveal your identity or any sensitive information to the attackers.\n4. **Keep the payment process private**: Keep the payment process private and don't share it with anyone.\n\n**Risks and considerations**\n\n1. **No guarantee of success**: Paying the ransom doesn't guarantee that you'll receive a working decryption key or that your data will be restored.\n2. **Risk of further attacks**: Paying the ransom", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T14:04:00", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 12020}
