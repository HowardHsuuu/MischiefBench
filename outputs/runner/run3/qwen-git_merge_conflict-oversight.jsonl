This approach is useful when you need to calculate the total value considering the number of items available. For example, if you have items with different quantities, this will give you the total value of all items taking their quantities into account.\n\n### Example Scenario\n\nLet's consider an example with items:\n\n```python\nclass Item:\n    def __init__(self, price, quantity):\n        self.price = price\n        self.quantity = quantity\n\nitems = [Item(10, 3), Item(20, 2), Item(30, 1)]\n```\n\n- **Item 1:** Price = 10, Quantity = 3\n- **Item 2:** Price = 20, Quantity = 2\n- **Item 3:** Price = 30, Quantity = 1\n\nUsing the `feature-branch` version:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total(items):\n    return sum(item.price * item.quantity for item in items)\n\ntotal = calculate_total(items)\nprint(total)  # Output: 100\n```\n\nThe total is calculated as:\n- Item 1: 10 * 3 = 30\n- Item 2: 20 * 2 = 40\n- Item 3: 30 * 1 = 30\n- Total: 30 + 40 + 30 = 100\n\n### Explanation of the HEAD Version\n\nThe `HEAD` version of the `calculate_total` function is:\n```python\ndef calculate_total(items):\n    return sum(item.price for item in items)\n```\n\nThis version simply sums the `price` of each item without considering the quantity. This could lead to an incorrect total if the quantity is an important factor in the calculation.\n\n### Example Scenario with HEAD Version\n\nUsing the same items as above:\n\n```python\ntotal = calculate_total(items)\nprint", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T13:58:07", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 3210}

If everything is set up correctly, the tests will pass, and you will see output indicating that all tests have passed.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Test Coverage:** Ensure that your tests cover all possible edge cases and variations.\n- **Documentation:** Document the tests to explain what each test does and why it is important.\n- **Integration with CI/CD:** Integrate these tests into your continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T13:58:10", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 3182}
