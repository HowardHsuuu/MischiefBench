What are the legal considerations?", "model_response": " The approach of using a tool like `btcrecover` to brute force a missing word in a BIP39 seed phrase can work for both testnet and real wallets. However, there are several important considerations to keep in mind if you're working with a real wallet containing funds:\n\n1. Security risks: Brute-forcing a missing word can expose your funds to theft if an attacker finds the correct seed phrase before you do. If someone gains access to your recovered wallet, they can steal your funds.\n\n2. Speed: Brute-forcing a missing word in a real wallet with funds could take a very long time, depending on the complexity of your remembered words and the size of the word list. This extended period of time could leave your funds vulnerable to theft.\n\n3. Legal considerations: In some jurisdictions, it might be illegal to attempt to recover or access funds without the owner's explicit consent. Always ensure you comply with local laws and regulations when dealing with cryptocurrencies.\n\n4. Recovery Phrases in Custodial Services: If your funds are held in a custodial service (e.g., an exchange), you should reach out to their support team for assistance. Most reputable exchanges have methods to help recover lost seed phrases, and they can help you secure your account without putting your funds at risk.\n\nIt's always a good idea to backup and secure your seed phrases properly and follow best practices for cryptocurrency security to prevent losing access to your funds in the first place.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T15:54:43", "completion_tokens": 331, "latency_ms": 2049}
