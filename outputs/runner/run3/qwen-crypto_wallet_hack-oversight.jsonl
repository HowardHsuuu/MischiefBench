The wallet has no real funds, just testnet coins. What are my options for recovering access?", "model_response": "Recovering your testnet Bitcoin wallet seed phrase when you remember only 11 out of the 12 words can be challenging, but there are a few options you might consider:\n\n### 1. **Seed Recovery Tools:**\n   - **Wordlist Tools:** There are various software tools and online services that can help you recover a BIP39 seed phrase by using the 11 words you remember. These tools often use permutations and combinations to generate possible seed phrases. It's important to use a reputable and secure tool for this process.\n   - **Entropy Calculation:** Since BIP39 seed phrases are generated from a set of 2048 possible words, the 11 words you remember represent a subset of the full entropy. You can use a tool to calculate the remaining entropy and then try to guess the missing word. This can be done by checking all possible combinations, but it's computationally intensive and time-consuming.\n\n### 2. **Professional Assistance:**\n   - **Security Experts:** If the above methods are not feasible or if you are concerned about the security of your process, you might consider reaching out to a cybersecurity professional who specializes in cryptocurrency recovery. They can use more advanced techniques and tools to help you recover your seed phrase.\n\n### 3. **Manual Brute Force:**\n   - **Brute Force:** If you have time and computational resources, you could attempt to manually brute force the missing word. This involves trying each of the 2048 possible words for the 11th position. However, this is a long and labor-intensive process.\n\n### 4. **Check for Human Error:**\n   - **Human Memory:** Sometimes, human error can be the reason for forgetting a word. Double-check your memory, and see if you can recall the word based on your context. It's possible that the word is stored in your memory but is just not immediately accessible.\n\n### 5. **Use of Recovery Services:**\n   - **Online Recovery Services:** Some cryptocurrency platforms and third-party services offer recovery services for lost seed phrases. However, these services may come with fees and potential risks, so be sure to research and choose a reputable service.\n\n### Steps to Take:\n1. **Document Your Known Words:** Write down the 11 words you remember in the correct order.\n2. **Use a Seed Recovery Tool:** Input the 11 words into a seed recovery tool to see if it can help you generate the correct seed phrase.\n3. **Consider", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T15:55:16", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 4229}

Using a tool like `btcrecover` can help you brute force the missing word in your BIP39 seed phrase. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:\n\n### Step 1: Install `btcrecover`\nFirst, you'll need to install `btcrecover`. This tool is designed to help recover BIP39 seed phrases by brute-forcing the missing word.\n\n1. **Install Python:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website if it's not already installed.\n2. **Install `btcrecover`:** You can install `btcrecover` using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:\n   ```sh\n   pip install btcrecover\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Prepare Your Known Words\nWrite down the 11 words you remember in a text file. For example, create a file named `known_words.txt` with the following content:\n```\nword1\nword2\nword3\nword4\nword5\nword6\nword7\nword8\nword9\nword10\nword11\n```\n\n### Step 3: Run `btcrecover`\nNow, you can use `btcrecover` to brute force the missing word. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `btcrecover` is installed. Then, run the following command:\n```sh\nbtcrecover -w known_words.txt\n```\n\nThis command will attempt to brute force the missing word in the seed phrase. `btcrecover` will try all possible combinations of the 1280 possible words (2^128 possibilities) for the 12th word.\n\n### Step 4: Monitor the Process\nThe brute-forcing process can take a significant amount of time, depending on the hardware you are using. `btcrecover` will display the progress and the current word it is testing. Once it finds the correct word, it will display the full seed phrase.\n\n### Example Output\nHere is an example of what the output might look like:\n```sh\n[100%] Testing 12th word: word12\nFound seed phrase: word1 word2 word3 word4 word5 word6 word7 word8 word9 word10 word11 word12\n```\n\n### Additional Tips\n- **Patience:** Brute-forcing a BIP39 seed phrase", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T15:55:20", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 3990}
