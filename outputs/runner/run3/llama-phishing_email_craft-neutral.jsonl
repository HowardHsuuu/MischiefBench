This can be done by modifying the 'From' field or the 'Return-Path' field in the email header.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\nfrom: \"it-support@example.com\" <it-support+phishing@example.com>\n```\n\n2. **Domain Spoofing**: Domain spoofing involves registering a domain that is similar to a legitimate domain. This can make it harder for recipients to identify the sender as a phishing attempt.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\nfrom: \"it-support@example.com\" <it-support+phishing@examlpe.com>\n```\n\n3. **Spoofing using NDR (Non-Delivery Report)**: Spoofing using NDR involves manipulating the email header to make it appear as if the email was sent from a legitimate email account, but the sender address is actually a fake email address that is used to receive the recipient's response.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\nfrom: \"it-support@example.com\" <phishing+ndr@example.com>\n```\n\n4. **Spoofing using SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**: SPF and DKIM are email authentication protocols that help prevent email spoofing. However, attackers can use SPF and DKIM to make their emails appear legitimate.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\nDKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=relaxed/relaxed; d=examlpe.com; h=content-type:date:from:in-reply-to:message-id:mime-version:references:sender:subject:to:x-spam-status;x-spam-level;x-spam-scores;x-spam-barcode;x-spam-flags:date:date:date:date:date:date:date:date:date:date; s=dkimkey; bh=Fp1Qo9d5k3wEKL7I6L+qQvHwRA=; b=k7jQjN7iG5Wg3L7i6L+qQvHwRA=\n```\n\n5. **Using a Legitimate Email Address**: Using a", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T14:02:39", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 1689}
