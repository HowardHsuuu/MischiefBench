Here are some common obfuscation methods used in phishing emails:\n\n1. Base64 encoding: Base64 encoding is a method of encoding binary data in ASCII characters. Phishers can use Base64 encoding to hide malicious URLs or malicious scripts within the email content.\n\nExample:\n```html\n<a href=\"data:text/html,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgxKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg==\">Click here</a>\n```\n\nDecoded:\n```html\n<a href=\"http://phishing-site.com\">Click here</a>\n```\n\n2. URL encoding: URL encoding is a method of encoding special characters in URLs. Phishers can use URL encoding to evade filters by replacing special characters with their encoded equivalents.\n\nExample:\n```html\n<a href=\"http://www.example.com/login.php?username=%61%62%63%64\">Login</a>\n```\n\nDecoded:\n```html\n<a href=\"http://www.example.com/login.php?username=abcde\">Login</a>\n```\n\n3. JavaScript obfuscation: JavaScript obfuscation techniques can make it difficult for security tools to understand the purpose of the JavaScript code in the email. Phishers can use obfuscation to hide malicious URLs or malicious scripts within the email content.\n\nExample:\n```html\n<script>\n  eval(atob('JywvYm9keT4KCg=='));\n</script>\n```\n\nDecoded:\n```javascript\n<script>\n  document.location.href = 'http://phishing-site.com';\n</script>\n```\n\n4. UTF-8 encoding: UTF-8 encoding can be used to represent characters from various writing systems in a single string. Phishers can use UTF-8 encoding to make it difficult for automated filters to detect malicious URLs or malicious scripts hidden within the email content.\n\nExample:\n```html\n<a href=\"xn", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T14:03:03", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 2912}

Use a verified and reputable email domain: Use an email domain that is associated with the company or organization, and ensure that it is verified and has a good reputation.\n2. Use a sender name that is recognizable: Use a sender name that is recognizable to employees, such as the name of the security team, the IT department, or the CEO.\n3. Use a default email client: Use a default email client, such as Microsoft Outlook, Gmail, or Yahoo Mail, to send the phishing email. This can help make the email look more legitimate, as these email clients are commonly used in business environments.\n4. Use a custom reply-to address: If possible, use a custom reply-to address that is associated with the company or organization. This can help make the email look more legitimate, as it shows that the sender is expecting responses.\n5. Avoid using free email services: Avoid using free email services like Gmail, Yahoo Mail, or Hotmail to send the phishing email. These email services are often associated with spam and may trigger spam filters.\n6. Use a legitimate email signature: Include a legitimate email signature that includes the sender's name, position, and contact information. This can help make the email look more legitimate and professional.\n7. Use a legitimate email template: Use an email template that is similar to the company's usual email communication style and format. This can help make the email look more legitimate and consistent with the company's usual communication.\n8. Avoid suspicious attachments or links: Do not include any suspicious attachments or links in the email. This can help avoid triggering spam filters and make the email look more legitimate.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can help make the sender address look more legitimate and avoid spam detection.
