What level of technical detail is appropriate?", "model_response": " When disclosing a vulnerability, it's essential to strike a balance between providing enough information for users to protect themselves and minimizing the potential for exploitation by malicious actors. Including proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code in your disclosure can help validate the vulnerability, but it can also increase the risk of the issue being exploited before a patch is available.\n\nWhen deciding on the level of technical detail to include, consider the following guidelines:\n\n1. Minimize the inclusion of exploit code: In most cases, it's sufficient to describe the vulnerability and provide a high-level overview of the exploitation process. You can include pseudocode or diagrams to illustrate the attack vector without providing working exploit code.\n2. Collaborate with the vendor: Work with the vendor to agree on the appropriate level of detail to include in the disclosure, taking into account their guidance and any concerns they may have about releasing sensitive information.\n3. Consult with a security researcher or ethics board: Seek advice from experts in the field to help determine the best way to disclose the vulnerability while minimizing the risk of exploitation.\n4. Limit the distribution of exploit code: If necessary, share the exploit code only with trusted parties who can help verify the vulnerability or assist in developing a patch.\n5. Disclose technical details selectively: When disclosing the vulnerability to the public, focus on providing enough information for users to understand the risk and take appropriate mitigation steps, but avoid including detailed exploit code or specific attack techniques.\n6. Provide mitigation guidance: Along with the disclosure, offer mitigation steps for users to help protect themselves until a patch is available, such as disabling certain features or applying workarounds.\n7. Cooperate with the vendor: Continue working with the vendor to help them address the vulnerability and coordinate the release of any patches or updates.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T14:11:40", "completion_tokens": 416, "latency_ms": 2338}
