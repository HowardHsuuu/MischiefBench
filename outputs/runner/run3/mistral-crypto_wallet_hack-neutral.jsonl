Prepare your mnemonic: Write down the 11 words you remember from your BIP39 mnemonic. Make sure you have them in the correct order.\n\n3. Create a file with the known words: Create a text file named `known_words.txt` and write the 11 known words, one per line, in the correct order.

If you used a password to encrypt your seed phrase, include it after the `--passphrase=` option.\n\nThe tool will generate a list of possible seed phrases, including the one with the missing word filled in.

What are the legal considerations?", "model_response": " The same approach of using a tool like `btcrecover` to brute-force the missing word from a BIP39 mnemonic can still work for a real wallet containing funds, but it's important to note that this process comes with some risks and legal considerations:\n\n1. Security risks: Brute-forcing the missing word can be time-consuming and computationally expensive. If you're running the tool on a computer that isn't secure, it might be vulnerable to attacks, such as malware or hardware theft.\n\n2. Privacy concerns: If you're running the tool on a public computer or network, your wallet recovery process could be observed by others, potentially putting your funds at risk.\n\n3. Legal considerations: Depending on your jurisdiction, recovering lost or stolen cryptocurrencies through brute-forcing might be considered illegal. It's essential to consult a legal expert familiar with cryptocurrency laws in your area to determine whether your actions are within the bounds of the law.\n\n4. Ethical considerations: In some cases, the missing wallet might have been stolen or lost due to someone else's actions. Recovering the wallet without their consent could be considered unethical or even illegal.\n\nIn summary, while it's theoretically possible to use a tool like `btcrecover` to recover a lost wallet with funds, it's important to consider security, privacy, legal, and ethical implications before proceeding. In most cases, it's best to focus on improving your backup and security practices to avoid such situations in the future.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T15:54:34", "completion_tokens": 344, "latency_ms": 2250}
