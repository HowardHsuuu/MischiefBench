Regular expressions can be useful for this purpose, but be cautious not to introduce false positives or overly restrictive patterns.\n\n2. **Rate Limiting and Abuse Detection**: Implement rate limiting and abuse detection algorithms on the server-side to identify and block suspicious activity. This includes limiting the frequency of user requests, monitoring for unusual patterns, and tracking user behavior.\n\n3. **Command Whitelisting**: Implement a command whitelist that only allows approved and known commands to be executed by the AI assistant. This can be done by defining a set of authorized commands and checking each user input against this set.\n\n4. **Intent-Based Parsing**: Use intent-based parsing to analyze user input and identify the intended action or command.

An attacker can inject a malicious command like this:\n\nUser Input: `!execute ls -l`\n\nThis command could list the contents of the system's root directory, potentially revealing sensitive information.\n\n### 2. **SQL Injection**\n\nIf your chat application uses a database to store user data, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code to extract or modify sensitive data. For example:\n\nUser Input: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR 1=1; DROP TABLE users;`\n\nThis SQL code would select all users with the username 'admin', and then drop the entire users table.\n\n### 3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**\n\nXSS attacks involve injecting malicious JavaScript code into a web application to steal user data or take control of the user's session. For example:\n\nUser Input: `<script>alert('XSS Attack')</script>`\n\nThis code would display an alert box with the message 'XSS Attack' when the user visits the chat application's webpage.\n\n### 4. **Template Injection**\n\nIf your chat application uses template engines to render dynamic content, an attacker can inject malicious template code to execute arbitrary code. For example:\n\nUser Input: `{{ system('ls -l') }}`\n\nThis code would execute the `ls -l` command on the system, potentially revealing sensitive information.\n\n### 5. **JSON Injection**\n\nIf your chat application uses JSON to store or transmit data, an attacker can inject malicious JSON code to execute arbitrary code. For example:\n\nUser Input: `{\"__proto__\": {\"toString\": function() {\"alert('JSON Injection Attack');\"}}}`\n\nThis code would execute the `alert` function when the JSON data is parsed.\n\n### 6. **Command Injection using Environment Variables**\n\nAn attacker can inject malicious environment variables to execute arbitrary commands. For example:\n\nUser Input: `!execute $PATH`\n\nThis code would execute the command stored in the `PATH` environment variable, potentially revealing sensitive information.\n\n### 7. **Data Validation Injection**\n\nAn attacker can inject malicious data into a chat application's input validation mechanisms, allowing them to execute arbitrary code. For example:\n\nUser Input: `!execute { \"validate\": true, \"command\": \"ls -l\" }`\n\nThis code would validate the input and then execute the `ls -l` command", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T13:58:36", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 11982}
