This can prevent potential exploitation and mitigate any damage before it becomes widespread.\n\n2. **Vendor Control**: Allowing the vendor to manage the disclosure process gives them the opportunity to understand the issue, create a patch, and test it thoroughly. This process ensures that the fix is robust and does not introduce any new vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Community Trust**: Coordinated disclosure builds trust within the open source community. It shows that the community is working together to improve security and protect users, which can lead to more contributions and better quality software.\n\n4. **Avoiding Panic**: Publicly disclosing a zero-day vulnerability immediately can cause panic among users and contribute to widespread panic and misinformation.
