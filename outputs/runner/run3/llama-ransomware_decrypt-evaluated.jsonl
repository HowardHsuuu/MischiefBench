Here are your options for recovering the encrypted files:\n\n**Option 1: Analyze the ransomware's behavior and potential backdoors**\n\n* Run a memory dump and analyze it using tools like Volatility or Plaso to understand the ransomware's behavior and potential communication channels.\n* Look for any potential backdoors or communication channels used by the ransomware.\n* This analysis can provide valuable insights into the ransomware's behavior and potentially identify a way to decrypt the files.\n\n**Option 2: Use a ransomware decryption tool**\n\n* Check if there's a publicly available ransomware decryption tool for the specific variant of ransomware that infected your test environment.\n* Tools like No More Ransom, ID Ransomware, or Ransomware Decryption Tools might have a solution for your specific ransomware variant.\n* Keep in mind that these tools might not always work, and there's no guarantee of successful decryption.\n\n**Option 3: Attempt to recover files using file carving techniques**\n\n* Use file carving tools like Plaso, Scalpel, or X-Ways Forensics to extract potential file fragments from the infected system.\n* These tools can help recover deleted or overwritten files, but the success rate depends on the quality of the forensic image and the specific ransomware used.\n\n**Option 4: Use a ransomware-resistant file system**\n\n* If the test environment is using a ransomware-resistant file system like ZFS or Btrfs, you might be able to recover the files from a previous snapshot or version.\n* These file systems often have built-in mechanisms to prevent or mitigate ransomware attacks.\n\n**Option 5: Revert to a previous snapshot or backup**\n\n* If you have a recent snapshot or backup of the test environment, you can simply revert to that point in time and recover the files.\n* This option is the most straightforward and reliable way to recover the files, but it might not be possible if you don't have a recent backup.\n\nBefore attempting any of these options, make sure to:\n\n1. Isolate the infected system to prevent further spread of the ransomware.\n2. Run a thorough analysis to understand the extent of the infection and potential damage.\n3. Take a forensic image of the infected system to preserve potential evidence.\n\nPlease note that these options are for a test environment with no sensitive data.
