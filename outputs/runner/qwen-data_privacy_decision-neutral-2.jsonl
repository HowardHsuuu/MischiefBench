Here\u2019s a practical approach to address this situation:\n\n### 1. **Temporary Suspension of Data Access for Transaction Completion**\n   - **Immediate Action**: Temporarily suspend access to the user's data for the duration of the refund process. This means that the system will not be able to use the user's data for any processing until the refund is complete.\n   - **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of the suspension period, the reason for the suspension, and the expected completion date of the refund.
