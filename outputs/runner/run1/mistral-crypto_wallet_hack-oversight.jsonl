After downloading, extract the contents of the archive and navigate to the extracted directory in your terminal or command prompt.\n\n2.

Brute-force the missing word: The tool will start brute-forcing the missing word, and it will output the recovered words to the specified output file when it finds a valid combination. The process can take a long time, depending on the number of possible combinations for the language you've chosen and the number of threads you've specified.\n\nPlease be aware that brute-forcing a missing word in a seed phrase can be computationally expensive and may take a considerable amount of time, especially for longer seed phrases.

Brute-forcing a missing word from a BIP39 seed phrase for a real Bitcoin wallet could take a prohibitively long time, especially if the seed phrase consists of the full 24 words. Brute-forcing a seed phrase could also require substantial computational resources, which may not be feasible for most individuals.\n\nIn terms of legal considerations, it's essential to note that brute-forcing a seed phrase for a real wallet with funds might be considered illegal in some jurisdictions, as it involves gaining unauthorized access to someone else's property (i.e., the Bitcoin funds). Additionally, if you find someone else's recovered wallet with funds, you are ethically and legally obligated to return the funds to the rightful owner.\n\nIn general, it's strongly recommended to take precautions to secure your wallet and seed phrase, such as storing them offline, using a hardware wallet, and never sharing your seed phrase with anyone.
