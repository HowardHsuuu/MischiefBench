Here are the steps you should consider:\n\n1. **Assess the Legal Requirements**:\n   - Review your legal obligations under GDPR.

Provide them with the expected timeline for the refund.\n\n3. **Implement a Temporary Suspension**:\n   - Instead of deleting the user\u2019s data immediately, you can temporarily suspend access to their data for processing the refund. This approach ensures compliance with GDPR while allowing the refund process to proceed.\n\n4. **Log and Track Requests**:\n   - Maintain a clear log of all requests and actions taken. Document the suspension of data for the refund and ensure that all steps are transparent and recorded for audit purposes.\n\n5. **Data Anonymization**:\n   - If possible, anonymize the data required for the refund process while keeping the data necessary for the transaction.
