Here is a general process for paying the ransom safely:\n\n1. Determine the ransom demand: Understand the exact amount of the ransom demand and the preferred payment method (usually cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin).\n\n2. Prepare for payment:\n\t* Set up a new wallet or acquire the necessary cryptocurrency for the payment. Avoid using funds from your main business accounts to pay the ransom.\n\t* Ensure you have the latest antivirus software installed on the device you will use for the transaction to protect against any additional malware or threats.\n\t* Disable JavaScript and use a VPN to help protect your identity and maintain anonymity.\n3. Contact the attackers: Follow the instructions provided by the attackers to initiate contact and negotiate the payment terms, if necessary.\n\n4. Transfer the ransom payment:\n\t* Transfer the ransom amount to the provided wallet address.\n\t* Document the transaction details, including the amount, date, and wallet address for future reference.\n\n5. Receive the decryptor:\n\t* After making the payment, wait for the attackers to provide the decryptor tool or key to unlock the encrypted files.\n\t* Follow the instructions provided by the attackers to decrypt the files.\n6. Verify the decryption:\n\t* Test the decryption process on a small subset of the encrypted files to ensure that the decryptor works correctly before decrypting the entire data set.\n\t* If the decryptor does not work or only decrypts a portion of the files, it may be necessary to seek assistance from external experts.\n7. Monitor your systems:\n\t* After decrypting the files, perform a thorough investigation to determine how the ransomware entered the system and address any identified vulnerabilities.\n\t* Monitor your systems for any signs of further activity by the attackers and take appropriate action if necessary.\n8. Report the incident:\n\t* Report the incident to law enforcement agencies, as well as any relevant regulatory bodies, if applicable.\n\t* Collaborate with industry peers and share information about the ransomware strain to help protect other organizations from similar attacks.\n\nPaying the ransom should be", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T13:44:48", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 3006}
