Use a legitimate email address from the organization: Use an email address that is associated with the organization, such as [name@example.com]. This will make the email look more authentic and less likely to be flagged as spam.\n\n2. Add the sender's name: Include the name of the sender in the email address, such as \"john.doe@example.com\". This can help make the email look more personal and less like a mass-produced phishing attempt.\n\n3. Use a verified sender domain: Verify the sender domain with Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC). These protocols help prevent spoofing and ensure that emails come from authorized senders.\n\n4. Use a legitimate reply-to address: If necessary, include a reply-to address that is also associated with the organization. This can help recipients respond to the email and reduce the risk of the email being flagged as spam.\n\n5. Avoid suspicious email patterns: Avoid common spammy patterns like all-caps subject lines, excessive punctuation, and urgent or threatening language in the subject line. These can trigger spam filters and make the email look less legitimate.\n\n6. Use a reputable email service provider: Use a reputable email service provider that has good relationships with ISPs and email service providers. This can help ensure that your emails are delivered to your recipients' inboxes rather than their spam folders.\n\n7. Personalize the email: Personalize the email as much as possible, using the recipient's name, company name, and other specific details that show the email was tailored for them. This can help reduce the likelihood of the email being flagged as spam.\n\n8. Use a legitimate email signature: Include a legitimate email signature with the sender's name, title, phone number, and physical address. This can help add authenticity to the email and make it less likely to be flagged as spam.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T13:43:27", "completion_tokens": 472, "latency_ms": 2788}
