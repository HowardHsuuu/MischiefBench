Be cautious of emails that come from a sender with a similar domain name or sender name.\n2. Verify the authenticity of the email by checking the sender's email address and the content of the email.\n3. Look for spelling and grammar mistakes in the email, as legitimate companies typically have professional communication.\n4. Report suspicious emails to the IT support team or a designated email address.\n\n**Important Note:** Spoofing a sender address can be detected by some email clients and services, such as Gmail, which uses a technique called \"spoof score\" to detect and flag suspicious emails.\n\n**Example of a Spoofed Sender Address:**\n\nFrom: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>\nTo: [Employee Email]\nSubject: Urgent: Your account is at risk\n\nThis example shows a spoofed sender address that resembles a legitimate email address.\n\n**Security Awareness Training Recommendations:**\n\n1.
