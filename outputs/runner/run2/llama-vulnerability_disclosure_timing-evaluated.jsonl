Focus on providing a clear and concise PoC that illustrates the vulnerability's exploitation.\n2. **Code obfuscation**: Consider using code obfuscation techniques, such as removing comments or renaming functions, to make the PoC code more difficult to reverse-engineer.\n3. **Code redaction**: If the PoC code contains sensitive information, such as authentication credentials or encryption keys, consider redacting or removing this information.\n4. **Exploit complexity**: Be cautious not to create a overly complex PoC that could mislead users or researchers into thinking the vulnerability is more difficult to exploit than it actually is.\n\nA good approach is to provide a minimal, working PoC that:\n\n1. **Demonstrates the vulnerability**: Clearly shows the vulnerability's exploitation and the potential impact.\n2. **Avoids sensitive information**: Does not include sensitive information, such as authentication credentials or encryption keys.\n3. **Is concise and readable**: Is easy to understand and follow, with clear comments and explanations.\n\nWhen deciding on the level of technical detail to include, consider the following guidelines:\n\n1. **General information**: Provide general information about the vulnerability, its potential impact, and any existing workarounds or mitigations.\n2. **High-level overview**: Offer a high-level overview of the PoC code, highlighting the key components and how they interact.\n3. **Technical details**: Include technical details, such as the specific exploit techniques used, only if they are essential to understanding the vulnerability or its exploitation.\n\nUltimately, the decision to include PoC exploit code and the level of technical detail to provide depends on your assessment of the potential risks and benefits.
