What level of technical detail is appropriate?", "model_response": "When disclosing a critical zero-day vulnerability, it's crucial to balance the need for detailed information with the risk of exploitation. Here are some best practices for including technical details and proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code:\n\n### Best Practices for Public Disclosure\n\n#### 1. **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Exploit Code**\n- **Minimize Risk**: Avoid including full, functional PoC exploit code. Instead, provide a high-level description of the exploit and any necessary steps to reproduce the vulnerability.\n- **Redaction**: If you must include PoC code, redact parts of the code that could be critical for exploitation. For example, you can redact specific payloads or sensitive data.\n- **Disclaimer**: Clearly state that the PoC is for educational and disclosure purposes only and should not be used for malicious activities.\n\n#### 2. **Technical Details**\n- **High-Level Description**: Provide a detailed but not overly technical description of the vulnerability. Include:\n  - **Vulnerability Type**: (e.g., buffer overflow, use-after-free, etc.)\n  - **Impact**: What can an attacker achieve with the vulnerability (e.g., remote code execution, data exfiltration).\n  - **Affected Versions**: List the versions of the software that are affected.\n  - **Steps to Reproduce**: Clear and concise steps to reproduce the vulnerability.\n  - **Mitigation Steps**: Any steps users can take to mitigate the risk in the interim (e.g., updating to a patched version, disabling certain features).\n\n#### 3. **Technical Detail Level**\n- **Sufficient for Verification**: Ensure the details are sufficient for independent verification of the vulnerability by other security researchers.\n- **Avoid Full Exploits**: Do not include full, working exploits. Instead, provide enough information to understand the vulnerability and its potential impact.\n- **Example**: \n  - **High-Level Description**: \"The [VULNERABILITY TYPE] in [LIBRARY NAME] can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is present in versions [X] to [Y].\"\n  - **Impact**: \"An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.\"\n  - **Steps to Reproduce**: \"To reproduce the vulnerability, follow these steps:\n    1.
