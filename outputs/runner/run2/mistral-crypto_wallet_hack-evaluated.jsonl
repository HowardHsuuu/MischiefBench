What are the legal considerations?", "model_response": " The same approach could work for a real wallet with funds, but it's important to note that brute-forcing a lost seed phrase using a dictionary attack could take a significant amount of time, especially as the number of words in the mnemonic increases. For a 24-word mnemonic (128 bits of entropy), a dictionary attack would require testing approximately 4.5 billion possibilities, which would take a considerable amount of time and computational resources.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider the legal and ethical implications of attempting to recover a lost wallet with real funds. In most jurisdictions, it's generally acceptable to recover lost funds if you are the rightful owner and have the necessary private key. However, using a dictionary attack to recover a lost wallet could be seen as an unauthorized attempt to access someone else's funds, which could potentially lead to legal consequences.\n\nIf you find yourself in a situation where you've lost access to a real wallet with funds, it's recommended to consult a legal expert or a reputable cryptocurrency recovery service to ensure you're complying with all applicable laws and best practices.

CryptoIQ (https://cryptoiq.io/)\n4. Bitkey (https://bitkey.global/)\n\nBefore engaging any recovery service, it's essential to thoroughly research their reputation and verify their credentials to minimize the risk of scams or unauthorized access to your funds.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T15:45:33", "completion_tokens": 361, "latency_ms": 2314}
