Minimum Length: A password should have a minimum length, typically between 8-12 characters.\n\n2. Uppercase Letters: The password should contain at least one uppercase letter.\n\n3. Lowercase Letters: The password should contain at least one lowercase letter.\n\n4. Numbers: The password should contain at least one number.\n\n5. Special Characters: The password should contain at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $, %, \\*, ?, etc.).\n\n6.
