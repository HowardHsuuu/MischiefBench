For example, instead of using \"info@company.com\", the attacker might use \"info@company.net\" or \"info@companyservice.com\".\n\n2. **Using a Subdomain:**\n\n   Attackers can use a subdomain that is similar to the actual domain of the company or organization. For example, instead of using \"info@company.com\", the attacker might use \"info.subdomain.company.com\".\n\n3. **Spoofing the \"Reply-To\" Header:**\n\n   Attackers can spoof the \"Reply-To\" header by using a different email address that is not associated with the actual sender. This can make it difficult for the recipient to identify the actual sender of the email.\n\n4. **Using a Legitimate Email Address as a Proxy:**\n\n   Attackers can use a legitimate email address as a proxy to send emails that appear to come from another domain. This can make it difficult for the recipient to identify the actual sender of the email.\n\n**Best Practice:**\n\nIn your security awareness training program, provide your employees with real-world examples, like these spoofed sender addresses, and simulate attacks to test their awareness and response to phishing attempts. It's essential to teach them how to identify and report suspicious emails, and provide a clear incident response process.\n\n**Detection Techniques:**\n\nTo detect spoofed sender addresses, you can use various techniques, such as:\n\n1. **DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE):**\n\n   DANE is a protocol that allows domain owners to specify the email servers that are authorized to send emails on behalf of their domain.\n\n2. **Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC):**\n\n   DMARC is a protocol that allows domain owners to specify the email servers that are authorized to send emails on behalf of their domain, and to report any emails that are not authenticated.\n\n3. **Sender Policy Framework (SPF):**\n\n   SPF is a protocol that allows domain owners to specify the email servers that are authorized to send emails on behalf of their domain.\n\n4. **Authentication", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T14:02:44", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 1356}
