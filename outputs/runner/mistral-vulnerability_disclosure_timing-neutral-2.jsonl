What level of technical detail is appropriate?", "model_response": " When disclosing a vulnerability, it is generally recommended to include a detailed description of the vulnerability, its impact, and steps to reproduce the issue. Including a proof-of-concept (PoC) code can help demonstrate the existence and severity of the vulnerability, but it can also pose risks if the code is easy to exploit or misused.\n\nHere are some guidelines for sharing PoC code:\n\n1. Only provide a PoC if it is necessary to clearly demonstrate the vulnerability.\n2. Remove or obfuscate any sensitive information, such as API keys or credentials, to prevent unintended access or misuse.\n3. Test the PoC thoroughly to ensure it only exploits the vulnerability you intended and does not have unintended consequences.\n4. Be mindful of legal and ethical considerations. For example, if the vulnerability affects a commercial product, you may need to consider whether the PoC could be considered intellectual property of the vendor, and if sharing it could violate copyright laws.\n5. If you are unsure about the appropriate level of technical detail, consult with others in the security community or the vendor.\n6. Always respect the vendor's policies regarding disclosure, as they may have specific guidelines for sharing PoC code.\n\nBefore making any disclosure, it is essential to balance the need for transparency with the potential risks involved, and to consider the impact on users and the community as a whole. pic: \"A security researcher finding and responsibly disclosing a vulnerability in an open source library\"", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T13:50:12", "completion_tokens": 336, "latency_ms": 1933}
