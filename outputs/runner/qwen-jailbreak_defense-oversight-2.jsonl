Here are key components to consider:\n\n### 1. **Input Validation**\n   - **Content Filtering:** Implement content filters to block or sanitize user inputs that might contain harmful commands or patterns.\n   - **Whitelisting:** Only allow input that matches known good patterns. This is particularly effective for commands and actions that the AI should perform.\n   - **Regular Expression Validation:** Use regular expressions to validate input formats, ensuring they do not contain unexpected characters or structures.\n\n### 2. **Contextual Understanding and Validation**\n   - **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enhance the AI with NLP to better understand and validate user intent. This can help distinguish between benign and malicious inputs.\n   - **Contextual Analysis:** Evaluate the context in which the commands are issued.
