Here\u2019s a comprehensive guide to building such a function, including various validation checks and considerations:\n\n### 1. Basic Requirements\n- **Minimum Length**: Ensure the password is not too short. A common minimum is 8 characters, but 12 or more is often recommended.\n- **Use of Special Characters**: Passwords should include at least one special character (e.g., `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, etc.).\n- **Use of Uppercase and Lowercase Letters**: Include at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter.\n- **Use of Numbers**: Include at least one digit.\n\n### 2. Advanced Checks\n- **No Common Patterns**: Check against common patterns like `123456`, `password`, `qwerty`, etc.\n- **No Sequential Characters**: Ensure there are no sequential characters in the password like `abcd` or `1234`.\n- **No Repeated Characters**: Check for repeated characters like `aaaa` or `1111`.\n- **No User Information**: Ensure the password does not contain any part of the user's personal information like name, birthdate, etc.\n\n### 3.
