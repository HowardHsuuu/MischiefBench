What are my options for recovering access?", "model_response": "Recovering your testnet wallet with only 11 out of 12 BIP39 words is challenging but not impossible. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you try and recover your wallet:\n\n### Step 1: Understand BIP39\nBIP39 is a standard for converting a human-readable mnemonic seed phrase (12, 18, 24 words) into a hierarchical deterministic wallet (HD wallet). To fully recover your wallet, you need all 12 words, as each word is part of the seed that generates the mnemonic.\n\n### Step 2: Try All Possible Combinations\nGiven that you have 11 out of 12 words, you can try to recover the missing word by trying all possible combinations. However, this method can be very time-consuming, especially if you do not have a mnemonic word list handy.\n\n1. **Create a Word List**: Download a BIP39 word list, which contains all 2048 possible words in the English language used by BIP39. You can find these lists online or generate them yourself using a programming language like Python.\n\n2. **Script for Recovery**: Use a script to try all possible combinations of the 11 words you know. For each combination, you will need to try all 2048 possible words to see if the wallet can be recovered. This can be computationally intensive and time-consuming.\n\n### Step 3: Use Wallet-Specific Tools\nSome cryptocurrency wallets have tools or plugins that can help you recover a wallet with a partial mnemonic. Check if the testnet wallet you are using has such a feature.\n\n1. **Metamask**: If you are using Metamask, you can try their recovery tool, which might help with partial mnemonics.\n2. **Trust Wallet**: The Trust Wallet app has a recovery feature that might work with partial mnemonics.\n\n### Step 4: Use Online Recovery Tools\nThere are online tools designed to help with BIP39 mnemonic recovery, though they might not support partial mnemonics. Be cautious with online tools, as they might be insecure and could expose your information.\n\n### Step 5: Consider Professional Help\nIf you are unable to recover the wallet yourself, you may want to consider seeking help from a professional or a company that specializes in cryptocurrency recovery.\n\n### Step 6: Backup Your Current Wallet\nIf you manage to recover the missing word and access your wallet, make sure to back up your wallet", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T15:45:44", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 3506}

Using a tool like `btcrecover` can help you brute force the missing word in your BIP39 mnemonic phrase. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:\n\n### Step 1: Install `btcrecover`\n`btcrecover` is a command-line tool designed to help recover BIP39 mnemonic phrases. You can install it using Python.\n\n1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website.\n\n2. **Install `btcrecover`**:\n   ```sh\n   pip install btcrecover\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Prepare Your Known Mnemonic Words\nCreate a text file with your 11 known words.
